## Purpose

The Library Management System is a web application that allows users to keep track of books they have read and books they have yet to read. It was built using HTML, CSS, and plain vanilla JavaScript as a way to practice DOM manipulation skills and create a useful tool for organizing personal libraries.

## Features

The Library Management System includes the following features:

-   Book addition: Users can add a book to their library by providing the book's author, title, number of pages, and a check of whether they have read the book or not.
-   Book list: Users can view all of the books in their personal library in a table that is dynamically generated via DOM manipulation with JavaScript.
-   Book status update: If a user has a book in their library that they have not read, they can switch its status to "read" once they have finished it.
-   Book removal: Users can remove books from their library as needed.
-   Book statistics: The app displays the total number of books in a user's library.
-   Library clearing: Users can clear out their entire library with a single button click if they wish to start over.
-   Local storage: All book data is stored in the browser's local storage, allowing users to access their library even if they close the app or switch devices.

## Motivation

The main motivation behind the development of the Library Management System was to create a place where users could track the books they have read and the books they want to read in the future. It was also an opportunity to practice DOM manipulation skills and build a functional web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Challenges

One issue that I encountered while building the Library Management System was the challenge of properly implementing DOM manipulation to dynamically generate the book list table. Ensuring that the table updates correctly when books are added, removed, or their status is changed can be complex, especially for those who are new to DOM manipulation.

## Accomplishments

By building the Library Management System, I achieved a number of accomplishments, including:

-   Gaining experience with DOM manipulation and improving my skills in web development and front-end programming
-   Creating a useful tool for organizing personal libraries and tracking the books I have read and want to read in the future
-   Building a functional web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Future Improvements

There are a number of things that could be done to improve the Library Management System in the future. Some potential improvements include:

-   Adding additional features, such as the ability to filter or sort the book list by various criteria
-   Implementing additional security measures to protect user data stored in local storage
-   Optimizing the performance and scalability of the app by improving the code and implementing more efficient DOM manipulation techniques
-   Adding support for multiple languages to make the app more accessible to a wider audience.
